# Project2-CS50W
This is the third project of the CS50w Web Development Course. This is an ecommerce site where you can auction products and bid on them. It uses Django for the backend, SQLite for
the database, and Bulma to handle most of the CSS. You can register users, log in, comment on the listings, bid on auctions and add items to a personal watchlist. To run the site
simply open a terminal on the main directory and use the command `python manage.py runserver`.
